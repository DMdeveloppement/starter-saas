# How to begin?

Start with cloning the starter project into `myApp` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/andelz/angular-supabase-stripe-starter.git myApp
```

Now change the projects origin to keep track of your upcoming changes in your own repository:
```
git remote set-url origin <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>
```

## The client part
Enter client directory `./client` and run `npm i`. Once this is done you can start the client by running `npm start`.

## Setup the backend
Follow steps described in [Setup Supabase](docs/supabase.md) and [Setup Stripe](docs/stripe.md).
